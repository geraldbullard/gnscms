                      <p>You are on the Dashboard page now. This page will later be given more use for stats, members, messaging and more as the <strong>gnsCMS &copy;</strong> system grows in scope.</p>

Its simplicity and power are one of the noted features of <strong>gnsCMS &copy;</strong></p>

                      <p>The <strong>Settings</strong> area has been added to assist in the area of repeated use data and settings across the site front end. This area will help Developers and Theme creators with a database table available to hold configuration settings, site-wide data (names, contact info, addresses, titles etc) and any "switchable" settings needed in that creation process.</p>

                      <p>When adding a new page, you can now select from stock page layouts if the Theme provider has supplied them in the correct location in the theme folder structure.

                      <p>The ability to add multiple languages and select the language of your choice from a dropdown in the footer has been added. Later improvments will include admin user specific language settings, giving each admin the ability to save his or her prefernce for which current admin language is in use during the user session. There is already a cookie session that is set upon the first login for each user, saving the language preference for 30 days.</p>
